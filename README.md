# Google-Cloud-Deploy

Cloud Deploy managed your CI/CD deployment in very easy way
 1. Get started with CI/CD
 2. git clone <this repo>
 3. Create your GKE clusters
 4. connect them with your Machines
 5. Get ready your skaffold configurations
   - if your doesn't have it install skaffold in pc and do 'skaffold init' to generate skaffold.yaml 
 6. Create your delivery pipeline and targets for dev and prod clusters
 7. now you have targets defined , now we can create release for pipeline
 8. push your image to gcr or artifact registry  
 9. promote your release to prod cluster
 Thanks
